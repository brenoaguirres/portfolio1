        I'm a professional software developer and i currently own part of a startup
        where we work in the field of technology education for kids and teenagers. 
        I'm writing a book and a course that uses a gamified aproach to teach programming for young 
        students along with a game that complements the lessons.
        <br><br>
        I'm specialized in using Javascript and Python for web development and data science. 
        I also have a pretty good knowledge of C# inside the Unity Engine. I'm capable of 
        creating UX design and game design.
        <br><br>
        I can speak Portuguese, English and French.
        <br><br>
        I consider myself a chameleon professional since i have versatile abilities that can be
        used at various fields of work. My main goal is to always work with creativity, curiosity
        and the best posible humor, sharing experiences with my colleagues and valuing a pleasant
        and productive environment, where i can collaborate to reach the goals of the team.
